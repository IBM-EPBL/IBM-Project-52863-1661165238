# PROJECT PREVIEW:

• Rainfall has been a major concern these days. Weather conditions have been changing for time being. Rainfall forecasting is important otherwise, it may lead to many disasters. Irregular heavy rainfall may lead to the destruction of crops, heavy floods that can cause harm to human life. It is important to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity, and pre-planning of water structures.

• This comparative study is conducted concentrating on the following aspects: modeling inputs, Visualizing the data, modeling methods, and pre-processing techniques. The results provide a comparison of various evaluation metrics of these machine learning techniques and their reliability to predict rainfall by analyzing the weather data.

• We will be using classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, and xgboost. We will train and test the data with these algorithms. From this best model is selected and saved in pkl format. Once the model is saved, we integrate it with flask application and also deploy the model in IBM.

# Problem statement: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113667062/198827303-e2582092-28c0-459d-91ee-f909d270f545.png)

Rainfall has been a major concern these days. Weather conditions have been changing for time being. Rainfall forecasting is important otherwise, it may lead to many disasters. Irregular heavy rainfall may lead to the destruction of crops, heavy floods that can cause harm to human life. It is important to exactly determine the rainfall for effective use of water resources, crop productivity, and pre-planning of water structures. Thus, our problem is to analyse the rainfall data in India in order to help the growth of agriculture by predicting the occurrence of heavy rainfall to prevent flooding and damage in crops.

# Novelty: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113667062/198827390-d170eeda-44c8-4ae1-a5ac-008b10fb5b15.png)

Rainfall prediction is important as heavy rainfall can lead to many disasters. The prediction helps people to take preventive measures and moreover the prediction should be accurate. So, it is important to analyse rainfall in order to prevent damage in crops.

# Social Impact: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113667062/198827436-c2402faa-0b59-4b57-a22e-0734265b9122.png)

India is an agricultural country and secondary agro based market will be steady with a good monsoon. Thus, the prediction of amount of rainfall can play a major role in agricultural field.
